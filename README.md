<b>Day 2 - Calculating averages </b>

   Description:

Let's build a calculator that can calculate the average for an arbitrary number of arguments.

The test expects you to provide a Calculator object with an average method:

Calculator.average()

The test also expects that when you pass no arguments, it returns 0. The arguments are expected to be integers.

It expects Calculator.average(3,4,5) to return 4.
